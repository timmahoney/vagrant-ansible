# Vagrant starter box, provisioned with Ansible

This package will get you started using Vagrant and Ansible together. If you have the latest versions of both Virtualbox and Vagrant, this will work.

Host Software: 
Vagrant >= 1.6
VirtualBox >= 4.3.12

It will give you a very simple box. Nothing on it but some text editors and a few system monitors.

From here, it's super easy to get LAMP set up. Give it a try!
